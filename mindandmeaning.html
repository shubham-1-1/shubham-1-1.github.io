                        <p>Look at Rama—a prince who accepted vanavāsa with grace, endured every trial in silence, and departed quietly after fulfilling his duty. Look at Krishna—the God of love, who could not stay with his parents, nor with the one he loved the most; loving deeply, yet always learning to let go, as if love itself was his sacrifice. Look at Shiva—the source of all creation, yet the possessor of nothing. </p>

Ask your children: should I be manipulative or upright? Do not follow Ratnakara’s path of wrongdoing—choose Valmiki’s way of integrity, heart, and courage.</p>
